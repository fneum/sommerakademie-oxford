# Material for Dare International Workshop 2025

## Usage

### Building the book

If you'd like to develop and/or build the Data Science for Energy System Modelling book, you should:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (it is recommended you do this within a virtual environment)
3. (Optional) Edit the books source files located in the `dare-workshop/` directory
4. Run `jupyter-book clean dare-workshop/` to remove any existing builds
5. Run `jupyter-book build dare-workshop/`

A fully-rendered HTML version of the book will be built in `dare-workshop/_build/html/`.
